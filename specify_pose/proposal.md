## Introduction

**Purpose statement**

This proposal suggests that the `//pose` should have an option to specify the
rotation representation.

Currently, the text within `//pose` consists of a 6-tuple representing
`{xyz} {rpy}`, where `{xyz}` is a 3-tuple representing translation (in meters)
and `{rpy}` is a 3-tuple representing rotation (in radians).

When writing models, there are two drawbacks to this representation:
(1) specifying rotation in radians adds overhead when hand-crafting models
because the author must specify common degree values (e.g. 30, 45, 60, 90
degrees) in radians, and authors may use different precisions in different
circumstances, and, at a lower priority, (2) it is
sometimes hard to visually separate translation from rotation.

This proposal intends to resolve on point (1) by adding `//pose/rotation/@type`
where degrees can be specified, and *could* address point by structuring the
element differently (see below).

## Syntax

This proposal suggests that the following fixed pose representation:

```xml
<pose>{xyz} {rpy_radians}</pose>
```

should be *either* one of the following formats:

### Option A: Child Elements

```xml
<pose>{xyz} {rpy_radians}</pose>  <!-- Old format; deprecated. -->

<pose>
    <translation>{xyz}</translation>
    <rotation type="rpy_degrees">{rpy_degrees}</rotation>
</pose>

<pose>
    <translation>{xyz}</translation>
    <rotation type="q_wxyz">{wxyz}</rotation>
</pose>

<pose>
    <translation>{xyz}</translation>
    <rotation type="rpy_radians">{rpy_radians}</rotation>  <!-- This is not recommended. -->
</pose>
```

*or*:

### Option B: Rotation Type Attribute

```xml
<pose>{xyz}  {rpy_radians}</pose>
<pose rotation_type="rpy_radians">{xyz}  {rpy_radians}</pose>
<pose rotation_type="rpy_degrees">{xyz}  {rpy_degrees}</pose>

<!-- Not yet confirmed -->
<pose rotation_type="q_wxyz">{xyz}  {q_wxyz}</pose>
```

## Motivation

In models, one may come across values that look like this in `//pose`:

```xml
<pose>0.25 1.0 2.1 -2 0 0</pose>
<pose>0 0 0 0 1.5708 0</pose>
<pose relative_to='base'>1 2 3  0 0 0</pose>
<pose>0 0 0 0 0 1.5707963267948966</pose>
<pose>0 0 0 1.57079632679 0 0</pose>
<pose>0.29175 0 0.0335 0 0.261799364 0</pose>
<pose>9.56106065 0.917 -0.0365 0 0 3.14159</pose>
<pose>1.549414224 0.387353556 0.5109999999999999 0.0 -0.17453292519943295 1.570796</pose>
<pose>0.0049 0.092 0.027 1.57 -0.40 0.0</pose>

<!-- xacro -->
<pose>0 0 0.084 0 0 ${pi / 2}</pose>
<pose>0 ${-body_width/4 - body_space_width/4} ${body_bottom_box_height + body_space_height/2} 0 0</pose>  <!-- Note: Missing zero -->
```

This shows both of the aforementioned issues:

1. With several of the poses, it's a tad hard to see the translation vs. rotation. In fact, with one of the longer expressions, a zero was accidentally
excluded due to how long the expression is overall.

2. Notice the varying degrees of precision used to repesent 90 degrees
(1.57-ish radians). Also, note how that for Xacro uses, `${pi / 2}` is used
*solely* to convert from degrees to radians, rather than more relevant things
like computing incremental changes in orientation.

For units for radians, comments *could* be used to help (e.g.
`<!-- This means X in degrees -->`), but ideally, the specification handles
this in an active and self-documenting way.

For Option A, the specification can handle the separation between translation
and rotation as separate elements.

For Option B, `libsdformat` and SDFormat tutorials should encourage additional
whitespace, e.g. to separate translation and rotation, use 3 spaces (instead of
1) as a delimiter between values if they fit on one line, or use a newline
(possibly with hanging indents) if they do not fit on one line.

To help inform this proposal, the authors conducted a brief survey. See the
[Survey](#survey) section below for more information.

## Proposed changes

### 1.A. `//pose/translation` and `//pose/rotation`

The value of `//pose` could now be specified as `//pose/translation` and
`//pose/rotation`, and the representation for the rotation will be specified
using `//pose/rotation/@type`.

**Details**

* `//pose/translation` will remain a 3-tuple of strings representing
floating-point values. If unspecified (either the tag is not specified or is
empty), then those values will default to `0 0 0`.

* `//pose/rotation` will have more structure. See the section below.

* There will be backwards compatibility for the old form of expressing
`//pose`. See section below for more details.

#### 1.B. `//pose/@rotation_type`

*Use `//pose/@rotation_type`*

This will help decrease the verbosity; however, it will still make the visual
separation between translation and rotation harder to distinguish.

This would be a bit "more" backwards-compatible in terms of looking more
similar, and general "backwards-compatibility" will be much easier to implement
(in `libsdformat` and other implementations).

For separating the tuples, it may be possible to achieve this by making a
suggested style to insert more whitespace (newlines or additional spaces), and
reflect this style when outputting XML (as mentioned above).

**Other Alternatives Considered**

*Use `@orientation_type` instead of `@rotation_type`*

More verbosity, a bit harder to type.

*As Attributes*

While SDFormat could use attributes for these values like URDF does, it would
go against the convention used for other elements (e.g.
`//joint/axis/translation`, `//inertia/ixx,...`).

Additionally, allowing the rotation type to be represented implicitly by
mutally exclusive attributes (e.g. `rpy`, `rpy_degrees`, `q_wxyz`) may
complicate parsing to an extent.

*Use `//pose/rot` instead of `//pose/rotation`*

While `rot` is shorter, it would be nicer to be explicit. (This can be
reconsidered.)

*Use `//pose/orientation` instead of `//pose/rotation`*

It's unclear which one may be better. In ROS, `rotation` is used for a
transform, while `orientation` is used for a pose. However, they both appear
equivalent.

#### 1.1 (A) Values for `//pose/rotation/@type` or (B) (`@rotation_type`)

The values of `@type` (or `@rotation_type`) that are permitted:

* `rpy_degrees` - A 3-tuple representing Roll-Pitch-Yaw in degrees, which maps
to a rotation as specified here.
    * This should be used when the rotation should generally be human-readable.
* `rpy_radians` - Same as `rpy_degrees`, but with radians as the units for each
angle. This is provided for legacy purposes and ease of conversion.
    * It is not suggested to use this for a text-storage format.
    * Same precision as suggested below for quaternions: Use 17 digits of
    precision, and consider separating each value on a new line.
* `q_wxyz` - Quaternion as a 4-tuple, represented as  `(w, x, y, z)`, where `w`
is the real component. This should generally be used when the rotation should be
machine-generated (e.g. calibration artifacts).
    * It is encouraged to use 17 digits of precision when possible (C++'s
    default from `std::numeric_limits<double>::max_digits10`).
        * In Python, this can be done with using the format specifier
        `{value:.17g}` (for a 64-bit float stored in `value`).
    * Consider separating long values on new lines.
    * It is encouraged to prefer upper half-sphere quaternions (`w >= 0`).

Examples:

```xml
<pose>
    <translation>{xyz}</translation>
    <rotation type="rpy_degrees">90 45 180</rotation>
</pose>

<pose>
    <translation>{xyz}</translation>
    <rotation type="q_wxyz">
        0.27059805007309851
        -0.27059805007309845
        0.65328148243818818
        0.65328148243818829
    </rotation>
</pose>

<pose>
    <translation>{xyz}</translation>
    <rotation type="rpy_radians">  <!-- This is not recommended. -->
        1.5707963267948966
        0.78539816339744828
        3.1415926535897931
    </rotation>
</pose>

**Alternatives Considered**

*Use `@representation` instead of `@type`*

While "representation" may be a better word than "type", it would be nice to be
less verbose while still being concise (e.g. avoiding abbreviations).

*Use `//pose/{rotation_type}` instead of
`//pose/rotation/@type="rotation_type"]`*

Specifying something like `//pose/rpy_radians` or `//pose/rpy_degrees` may
encounter some of the parsing complication for mutually exclusive tags, as
mentioned above.

*Let `@type` have a default value (e.g. `"rpy_radians"` or `"rpy_degrees"`)*

While this would be ideal in terms of brevity, it is a bit too implicit and may
prove for confusion, especially when mixing degrees and radians (which may then
yield "dumb" scaling factors that have to be debugged).

It is true that "rpy" itself is still a bit ambiguous (e.g. which version of
Euler angles used), but the author feels that we shouldn't support too many
versions, and it may be hard to converge on succinct representations at that
(e.g. are the versions defined in the popular `transformations.py` package
really that easy to understand?).

*Use `@type="quaternion"` instead of `@type="q_wxyz"`*

In general, it can be confusing when interfacing different libraries that use
different orderings for quaternions and those ordering are not readily stated
in the API (or even the documentation). Instead, the author recommends
explicitly enumerating this order in a relatively unambiguous way that is shown
directly in the specification.

*Add `@type="q_xyzw`, `@type="euler_intrinsic_rpy"`, `@type="matrix"`,
`@type="axis_angle"`, `@type="axang3`, etc.*

The author feels that too many representations and permutations may make it
really hard (and annoying) to support an already complex specification.

#### 1.1.1 Re-describe API Implications, potential sources of numerical error

The `ignition::math::Pose3d` stores its rotation as
`ignition::math::Quaternion`.

Therefore, when storing quaternions, users should be aware of what numeric
changes happen to their data (e.g. normalization), so they should generally
know where changes in precision may happen.

When converting to roll-pitch-yaw coordiantes, we should try to specify the
*exact* math being done. (e.g. a cross-reference to `Quaternion::Euler()`
accessor and mutator, but with the algorithm actually described in
documentation).

When converting between radians and degrees, we should try to specify *exactly*
what math is done, and how much precision should be expected to be lost by
`libsdformat` during the conversion (e.g. the exact representation of `pi` used
in code, the order of operations, etc.).

#### 1.2 Conversion to SDFormat 1.9

When SDFormat files are converted from SDFormat <=1.8 to 1.9, the `//pose` tags
will be adjusted to use `//pose/translation` and `//pose/rotation[@type="rpy_radians"]`.

The conversion command-line tool should also provide an option to use
`rpy_degrees`, with a precision amount for round-off to degrees by values of 5
(e.g. 0, 5, ..., 45, ..., 90 degrees).

#### 1.3 Emitting SDFormat Models

The following changes are necessary when emitting SDFormat files:

- The user should be able to control the output rotation type. For backwards
  compatibility, it will be `rpy_radians` by default.
- There should be an admission for "snapping to" well known values in either
  representation, within a given angular tolerance (degrees). This can help
  convert exisiting models to more readable units, and possibly with better
  intended accuracy.

## Examples

TBD

## Survey

The following is a brief survey on how a few other formats specify poses /
transforms.

### ROS

ROS provided suggestions for representing rotations / orientations: <br/>
[REP 0103](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0103.html)

<!--
TODO(eric.cousineau): It's unclear how this did or didn't influence URDF and
SDFormat development. We should rfind out and document here.
-->

### URDF

URDF provides the attributes `//origin/@xyz` and `//origin/@rpy`, as mentioned
here:
<http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/XML/link#Elements>

Example:
```xml
<origin xyz="{xyz}" rpy="{rpy_radians}"/>
```

### MuJoCo XML

Elements tend to have their poses defined by attributes, a combination of
`@pos` for translation and then one of `@quat` (in `wxyz` order),
`@axisangle`, `@euler`, `@xyaxes`, `@zaxis`:

* <http://www.mujoco.org/book/XMLreference.html#body>
* <http://www.mujoco.org/book/XMLreference.html#compiler>
* <http://www.mujoco.org/book/modeling.html#COrientation>

Some examples for `//body`, with default `//compiler` settings
(`@angle="degree"`, `@eulerseq="xyz"`):

```xml
<body pos="{xyz}" quat="{q_wxyz}" .../>
<!-- or -->
<body pos="{xyz}" euler="{rpy_degrees}" .../>
```

### Collada

Transforms for `//node` can be dictated by any combination of
`//translate`, 

See the available specification for children of `//node` in the specification
PDF for Collada 1.5:

* <https://www.khronos.org/collada/>

Some examples:

```xml
<translate>{xyz}</translate>
<rotate>{axis_xyz} {angle_deg}</rotate>
<!-- or -->
<matrix>
    {Rxx} {Rxy} {Rxz} {x}
    {Ryx} {Ryy} {Ryz} {y}
    {Rzx} {Rzy} {Rzz} {z}
    0 0 0 1
</matrix>
```

### glTF

Defined as a node under `//nodes`, and can either be composed of just `@matrix`
or `@translation` and `@rotation`:

* <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/0f74b714/specification/2.0/README.md#transformations>

Some examples:

```json
"rotation": [{qx}, {qy}, {qz}, {qw}],
"translation": [{x}, {y}, {z}],
... or ...
"matrix": [...]
```

### VRML

Defined using `//Transform` elements with optional `@translation` and
`@rotation` attributes:

* <https://www.web3d.org/documents/specifications/19776-1/V3.3/Part01/EncodingOfNodes.html#Transform>
* <https://www.web3d.org/documents/specifications/19776-1/V3.3/Part01/EncodingOfFields.html#SFRotation>

An example:

```xml
<Transform translation="{xyz}" rotation="{axis_xyz} {angle_radians}">
  ...
</Transform>
```

### SKEL

Similar to SDFormat but stored as `//transformation`:

* <https://dartsim.github.io/skel_file_format.html>

Example:

```xml
<transformation>{xyz} {rpy_radians}</transformation>
```

*Note*: I (Eric) am assuming radians for Euler angles for the SKEL format.
